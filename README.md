# Code Quiz

## Description
Description: This application is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions to test your JavaScript knowledge. 

This quiz application has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application emphasizes the use of JavaScript to display series of questions and collect user responses to determine whether the answers to a question are correct. Answers are scored and a final score is generated and stored with user's initials.
The quiz is timed and the timer starts when the user clicks Start button; the user is then presented with a question, once the question is answered, user is presented with another question, and so on. When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock and when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, the game is over. When the game is over, user can save initials with score.

This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
